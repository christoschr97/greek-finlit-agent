# Refactoring Notes: FinancialLiteracyAssessment

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Violation of Encapsulation**
- **Issue**: `app.py` was calling private method `_calculate_level()` from outside the class
- **Line**: `level = assessment._calculate_level(st.session_state.score)`
- **Why it's bad**: Private methods (prefixed with `_`) are internal implementation details and should not be accessed externally

### 2. **Direct Attribute Manipulation**
- **Issue**: Manually setting object attributes from outside
```python
assessment.score = st.session_state.score
assessment.answers = st.session_state.answers
```
- **Why it's bad**: Breaks encapsulation, bypasses validation, makes the object state inconsistent

### 3. **Inconsistent Usage Pattern**
- **Issue**: Created `FinancialLiteracyAssessment` object but didn't use its `assess_user()` method
- **Why it's bad**: The class provides a proper interface, but we reimplemented its logic externally, leading to code duplication and maintenance issues

### 4. **Tight Coupling**
- **Issue**: UI code knew too much about internal structure of the assessment class
- **Why it's bad**: Changes to the assessment class would require changes in multiple places

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added Public API Methods**
Added proper public methods to `FinancialLiteracyAssessment`:

```python
def record_answer(self, question_id: int, user_answer: str) -> bool:
    """Record a user's answer and update score automatically."""
    # Handles validation, scoring, and storage internally
    
def get_level(self) -> LiteracyLevel:
    """Get the user's literacy level based on current score."""
    
def get_level_name(self) -> str:
    """Get the user's literacy level name in Greek."""
```

### 2. **Refactored app.py to Use Public API**

**Before:**
```python
# Bad: Direct manipulation
assessment.score = st.session_state.score
assessment.answers = st.session_state.answers
level = assessment._calculate_level(st.session_state.score)

# Bad: Manual scoring logic in UI
is_correct = (answer == q['correct'])
if is_correct:
    st.session_state.score += 1
st.session_state.answers[q['id']] = {...}
```

**After:**
```python
# Good: Using public API
assessment.record_answer(q['id'], answer)
level_name = assessment.get_level_name()
```

### 3. **Proper State Management**
- Store the assessment object in session state instead of storing raw score/answers
- Let the assessment object manage its own state

**Before:**
```python
st.session_state.score = 0
st.session_state.answers = {}
```

**After:**
```python
st.session_state.assessment = FinancialLiteracyAssessment()
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Encapsulation**: Internal implementation is hidden, only public interface is exposed
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose
3. **Easier to Test**: Can test assessment logic independently from UI
4. **Easier to Maintain**: Changes to assessment logic don't require UI changes
5. **More Robust**: Validation and business logic is centralized in the class
6. **Consistent Usage**: Same pattern in both CLI (`main.py`) and web (`app.py`) interfaces

## Design Principles Applied

- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Hide internal implementation details
- ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each method does one thing
- ✅ **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Scoring logic exists in one place
- ✅ **Tell, Don't Ask**: Tell the object to do something, don't ask for its data and do it yourself
- ✅ **Law of Demeter**: Only interact with immediate friends (public API)

## What Was NOT Changed

- `assess_user()` method in CLI remains unchanged (it's appropriate for terminal interaction)
- Core assessment logic and questions remain the same
- Public constants like `QUESTIONS`, `LEVEL_NAMES` remain accessible (they're meant to be public)
